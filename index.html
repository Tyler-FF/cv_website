        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>With 9 yearsâ€™ experience in a variety of customer facing service roles, I am currently seeking a new challenge which will utilize this, together with my thorough attention to detail and collaborative, professional manner.</p>
            <p>I am currently expanding on, and formalising my interest in Computer Sciences and have begun online courses in programming; which I am thoroughly enjoying. I am seeking a career change into Full Stack Web Development. My experience in technical support has solidified my personal interest and enjoyment in problem solving, while nurturing my curiosity and subsequent understanding of new concepts in the pursuit of a solution. I believe my time in the customer service technician role gives me a unique perspective and a strong skill set that will aid me in my transition to a programing career.</p>
